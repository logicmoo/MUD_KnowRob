# We presuppose an infinite set N of names, and let u, v, w, x, y, z range over names.
# We also presuppose a set K of agent identifiers, each with an arity an integer >= 0.
# We let A, B, C, ... range over agent identifiers. We now let P, Q, R, ... range
# over the agents or process expressions, which are of six kinds as follows:

:Process a rdfs:Class.
:Port a rdfs:Class.
:empty a :Process.


# 1. A summation
# --------------
# sum_i Pi where the index set I is finite.
# This agent behaves like one or other of the Pi. We write 0 for the empty
# summation, and call it inaction; this is the agent which can do nothing.
# Henceforward, in defining the calculus, we confine ourselves just to 0 and
# binary summation, written P1 + P2 .
# e.g. (eg:process1 eg:process2) :summation eg:process.

:summation a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 2. A prefix form -yx.P , y(x).P or tau.P
# ----------------------------------------
# '-yx.' is called a negative prefix. y may be thought of as an output port of
# an agent which contains it; -yx.P outputs the name x at port y and then
# behaves like P .
# e.g. (eg:port1 (?name1 ?name2) eg:process1) :output eg:process.

:output a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 'y(x).' is called a positive prefix. A name y may be thought of as an input 
# port of an agent; y(x).P inputs an arbitrary name z at port y and then 
# behaves like P{z/x} (see the definition of substitution below). The name x 
# is bound by the positive prefix 'y(x).' (Note that a negative prefix does 
# not bind a name)
# e.g. (eg:port1 (?name1 ?name2) eg:process1) :input eg:process.

:input a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 'tau.' is called a silent prefix. tau.P performs the silent action tau and then 
# behaves like P.
# e.g. (eg:action1 eg:process1) :silent eg:process.

:silent a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 3. A composition P1 | P2
# ------------------------
# This agent consists of P1 and P2 acting in parallel. The components may
# act independently; also, an output action of P1 (resp. P2) at any output
# port x may synchronize with an input action of P2 (resp. P1) at x, to create
# a silent (tau) action of the composite agent P1 | P2 .
# e.g. (eg:process1 eg:process2) :composition eg:process.

:composition a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 4. A restriction (x)P
# ---------------------
# This agent behaves like P except that actions at ports -x and x are prohibited
# (but communication between components of P along the link x are not
# prohibited, since they have become tau actions as explained above).
# e.g. (?name1 eg:process1) :restriction eg:process.

:restriction a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 5. A match [x = y]P
# -------------------
# This agent behaves like P if the names x and y are identical, and otherwise
# like 0.
# e.g. ((?name1 ?name2) d:process1) :match eg:process.

:match a owl:FunctionalProperty; rdfs:domain rdf:List; rdfs:range :Process.


# 6. A defined agent A(y1, ..., yn)
# ---------------------------------
# For any agent identifier A (with arity n) used thus, there must be a unique 
# defining equation A(x1, ..., xn) == P, where the names x1, ..., xn are distinct
# and are the only names which may occur free in P . Then A(y1, ..., yn) behaves
# like P{y1/x1, ..., yn/xn} (see below for the definition of substitution).
# Defining equations provide recursion, since P may contain any agent
# identifier, even A itself.
# e.g. (eg:process1 eg:name1 eg:name2 eg:name3) :identifies eg:process.
